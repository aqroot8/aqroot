"""FBV2-P2-011 / D-309 -- SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the CURRENT authoritative
board fingerprint.

Every incremental read-only probe (incremental_probe_006..NNN,
phaseB_bringup_probe_005) and the G-contract regression pin the SAME live
authoritative board: its sha256, track / via / copper-layer / zone counts, the
ratsnest and the journal length.  Before D-309 these five constants were
declared IDENTICALLY inside each probe and had to be hand-edited (~25 identical
edits) on every promoted increment -- pure repetitive maintenance that the
Opportunity & Simplification Scan flagged.

This module centralises that pin to ONE place, bumped ONCE per promotion.  It is
a pure DRY consolidation and weakens NO historical contract: every probe still
asserts "live board == EXPECTED", exactly as before -- only the literal now lives
here instead of being copied into each file.  Each probe keeps ALL of its own
increment-specific structural / connectivity / DRC checks inline.

Bump procedure on each promoted increment: update the EXPECTED dict below to the
new authoritative sha / counts (the values `incremental_router.py baseline`
prints, or the promote summary).  Nothing else changes.
