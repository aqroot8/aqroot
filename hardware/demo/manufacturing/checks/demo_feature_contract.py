"""AQROOT Demo -- is every feature `AQROOT_DEMO_SCOPE.md` says MUST REMAIN
FUNCTIONAL actually on this board and actually wired? D-745.

EVERY OTHER CHECK IN THIS REPOSITORY IS A NO-REGRESSION CHECK.  `routing_ledger`
counts open edges, `contract_regression` diffs against a prior artifact,
`verify_promotion` compares a candidate with an authority.  All of them would
pass, unchanged and green, on a board that had never had a microphone -- because
none of them has ever been told what the product is supposed to DO.

The engineering charter asks for the opposite question before fabrication:
*"retained RF/NFC/USB/display/audio/IR/microSD/power features remain intact"*,
and it asks it ABSOLUTELY.  So this file transcribes `AQROOT_DEMO_SCOPE.md`'s
own list -- feature by feature, in its own words -- into references and nets,
and asserts three things per feature:

    F1  every named reference EXISTS on the board and is FITTED
        (a scope feature implemented by a DNP part is not implemented)
    F2  every named net is a real multi-pad net whose only open edge, if any,
        is one an owner decision covers
    F3  the approved-NC contacts are EXACTLY the eight `J5` positions Demo
        scope names -- no more, and no fewer

The table below is the deliverable, not the code.  It is deliberately verbose
and deliberately quotes the scope document, because the failure mode it guards
against is a board that passes every geometric check while quietly missing
something a backer was promised.

# F5 -- THE BACKLIGHT DISCONNECT'S CONTROL MAY NOT COLLAPSE BACK ONTO U17's.
# D-752.
#
# D-750 fitted `Q11` in the panel cathode return and put its GATE on
# `/DISP_BL_CTL`, the same net as `U17` `CTRL`, on the premise that PWM would
# shut the converter down and open the FET together.  TI SNVSA40B section 6.3.5
# says the opposite in its own words: the part "chops up the internal 204mV
# reference voltage at the duty cycle of the PWM signal", filters it, and
# therefore "only the WLED DC current is modulated, which is often referred as
# analog dimming".  THE CONVERTER KEEPS SWITCHING THROUGH EVERY PWM LOW PHASE;
# shutdown needs CTRL low for longer than tSD, 2.5 ms max.  A shared gate
# therefore opens the LED string while the converter regulates: FB collapses,
# SW ramps to VOVP_SW (36/37.5/39 V), open-LED protection latches the device
# off, and `Q11`'s drain follows the anode to about 36 V across a 30 V
# `AO3400A`.  The firmware already drives 5 kHz LEDC on GPIO46.
#
# The repair is structural rather than procedural: `D14` charges `C85` from
# `/DISP_BL_CTL`, `R132` discharges it, and the gate follows the ENVELOPE of
# CTRL with tau = 22 ms.  `Q11` cannot open until at least 11.4 ms of CTRL-low
# at worst-case tolerance, and `U17` is in shutdown by 2.5 ms -- so the
# converter stops FIRST, for ANY CTRL waveform, including one no firmware ever
# intended.  That ordering is the thing this clause protects, and it is
# protected by MEASUREMENT: the four facts below plus three live controls that
# put each way of losing it back and require F5 to refuse.

# D-766 -- THE DISCONNECT FET MUST SURVIVE THE FAULT IT IS THERE TO SURVIVE.
#
# D-752 wrote the number down and left the part fitted: with Q11 open while
# U17 regulates, "the panel cathode, which is Q11's DRAIN, follows the anode to
# ~36 V while R69 holds its SOURCE at 0 V.  THE AO3400A IS A 30 V PART".  The
# .kicad_dru is blunter still, and it is this board's OWN published ceiling for
# that node: "an open-LED fault puts up to 39 V on LED_BOOST".  Every clause in
# F5 measured the SEQUENCING that normally keeps the board out of that state --
# and not one of them could say that the silicon holding the state off was rated
# BELOW it.  An unfitted C85, an open D14 or a shorted R132 each re-create the
# state D-752 removed; a protection element has to survive its own failure mode.
#
# So the ceiling is READ OUT OF THE .kicad_dru rather than restated here, and
# compared against a per-part table of PUBLISHED ratings.  A FET this contract
# has no published rating for is refused rather than assumed.  The same judge
# also measures the two numbers D-752 argued in prose: that the held gate
# actually enhances the FITTED part, and that the gate cannot decay below the
# FITTED part's worst-case threshold before the TPS61169 is guaranteed to have
# shut down.  Swapping a FET with a different VGS(th) silently moves both.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# F6 -- THE ACCESSORY RAILS MAY NOT PULL THE PACK INTO ITS OWN PROTECTION,
# AND THE PACK PROTECTION MUST NOT FIRE ON A RAIL THE PRODUCT PUBLISHES.
# D-753 (envelope) + D-765 (limiter silicon) + D-771 (this decision).
#
# D-750 answered the external first-spin review's combined-load item with a
# POLICY: *"firmware must not raise both accessory rails to their per-rail
# maxima together"*.  A policy is not an enforcement mechanism.  THIS BOARD HAS
# NO ACCESSORY CURRENT MEASUREMENT -- firmware can choose whether a rail is ON,
# and cannot know what an arbitrary external accessory then draws.  The only
# thing that actually bounds an accessory is the load switch's own current
# limit, and at the values D-750 shipped those limits were far ABOVE what the
# policy permitted.
#
# So this clause computes the envelope from the two resistors that set it, and
# refuses the board if any state the Community Port can reach exceeds the pack
# protection's MINIMUM trip.  TI SLVSFJ2B / SLVSGP6A equation 1:
#
#     ILIM = 1.18 x (R_ILIM[kOhm]) ^ -1.072            (amps, kilohms)
#
# and the part's own EC table brackets that typ at 0.68x / 1.32x over
# -40..+125 C (the widest ratio it publishes, read off the 19.2 kOhm row).
#
# ---- D-771.  TWO THINGS THAT HAD NO WORDS HERE ---------------------------
#
# (1) THE ENVELOPE WAS ONLY EVER CHECKED FROM ABOVE.  Every clause D-753 and
#     D-765 wrote asks "can an accessory pull TOO MUCH".  None of them asks
#     whether the rail can deliver what the product PROMISES.  D-098 locks the
#     first five boards at ACC_3V3_SW = 400 mA TOTAL and ACC_5V_SW = 300 mA
#     TOTAL and requires those numbers to appear in accessory-facing
#     documentation in those words -- and at 2.7 kOhm each limiter GUARANTEES
#     only 0.277 A.  The board published a budget its own silicon could refuse
#     to deliver, on the two contacts the Community Port exists for.
#
# (2) THE CHAIN WAS ORDERED AGAINST A TYPICAL.  `double_fault_stays_inside_the
#     _protection_chain` compared the double-fault current against 3.3333 A --
#     50 mV / 15 mOhm -- as though 50 mV were a limit.  ADI's own EC table
#     (Rev C, archived at vendor/ADI/) guarantees the LTC4368 forward
#     overcurrent threshold only as 40 / 50 / 60 mV over temperature, so at
#     R75 = 15 mOhm +/-1 % the breaker's real band was 2.640 .. 4.040 A.  The
#     board D-765 shipped reaches 2.886 A in double fault -- ABOVE the 2.640 A
#     minimum -- so the clause was FALSE on the board that passed it.  And
#     RETRY is grounded (sheet 01 note, D-050/D-052/D-064/D-068): the LTC4368
#     breaker LATCHES OFF and is cleared only by toggling SHDN, while the
#     BQ25185's IBAT_OCP hiccups and retries.  The two bands overlapped by
#     1.05 A, so on an unlucky unit the LATCHING protection fired first.
#
# BOTH ARE NOW CLAUSES, and both are computed from board values.  R75 moves to
# 10 mOhm, which puts the breaker at 3.960 .. 6.061 A -- ENTIRELY ABOVE the
# IBAT_OCP band's 3.6875 A maximum, so the recoverable protection is now
# guaranteed to act first on every unit rather than on a typical one.

    # 2.8-inch CH280QV10-CT / ILI9341 pin table was DEAD ON ARRIVAL here --
    # LEDA/LEDK reversed and WRX/D-CX swapped, neither visible from a pin

    # Description, and LEFT THE RETIRED PANEL'S NAME IN THE MPN AND IN THE
    # PROVENANCE SENTENCE OF THE SAME SYMBOL -- so the symbol's own Package
    # field still credited "SPEC-CH280QV10-CT_Rev.D pages 6-7. TFT driver
    # ILI9341V" for a pin table transcribed from a different datasheet, one

    # aqroot-Demo-BOM-full.csv and -assembly.csv read "CH280QV10-CT Rev.D 2.8in
    # 240x320 IPS TFT + CTP" -- the document a human reads to buy the panel,

    # dead on arrival once for exactly this reason.

    # ONE deliberate exception: text that is explicitly ABOUT the retirement.
