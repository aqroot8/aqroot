# AQROOT Demo manufacturing preflight

Status: **BLOCKED** at board completion; no manufacturing candidate is approved.

The deterministic candidate exporter is `export_candidate.sh`. It writes only to
a new caller-supplied directory, generates full/fitted BOMs, an assembly position
file, all six copper layers, paste/mask/silkscreen/outline Gerbers, separate PTH
and NPTH drill files, and then runs `check_candidate.py`. Existing output is never
overwritten.

## 2026-09-02 baseline at `3e241dc`

- Board SHA-256: `cb4774b5ab76eb427bd70f0fb7dde17b7a1d7eb3c860826e94efeb7c9f91e93d`.
- All 14 expected Gerber/job files and both non-empty drill files exported; the
  drill report contains 139 PTH and 7 NPTH holes.
- Full BOM: 310 references. Schematic-fitted BOM: 294 references, with 16 DNP.
- CPL: 263 references.
- Real KiCad DRC: 205 board violations in the accepted baseline classes (199
  footprint-library, 5 hole-clearance, 1 solder-mask bridge), **plus 499
  unconnected-item errors** and 265 schematic-parity warnings.
- The 499 errors prove that the earlier RGB milestone completed only the four
  Demo replacement nets. The retained board is not routing-complete; its
  ratsnest was still 610 after RGB promotion.
- Schematic/PCB population parity is not release-safe: all 16 schematic DNP
  references leak into a PCB-derived CPL because their footprint DNP flags do
  not match: `C21 C22 C34 C35 C81 C82 L2 R44 R45 R68 R93 R107 R112 R119 R123 U13`.
- Procurement coverage is incomplete: 229 fitted references lack an MPN. Most
  are passives and test points, but `J8` is also in this set. This must be
  resolved through an explicit fitted/off-board/test-point population model,
  not by accepting an underspecified grouped BOM.

The generated files from this baseline are characterization artifacts only and
were deliberately not promoted into the repository. The authoritative Demo PCB
and schematic were not changed, and `hardware/beta-v2/` remained untouched.

## Next bounded task

Return to retained-net routing completion. Build a Demo-specific routing ledger
from real KiCad connectivity, classifying only the eight approved J5 contacts as
NC. Use it to choose the largest safe retained-net cluster for the next copper
promotion. Manufacturing export resumes only after all retained connections are
closed. Population-flag synchronization and MPN coverage remain subsequent
release blockers.
