# AQROOT Demo manufacturing preflight

Status: **BLOCKED** at board completion; no manufacturing candidate is approved.

The deterministic candidate exporter is `export_candidate.sh`. It writes only to
a new caller-supplied directory, generates full/fitted BOMs, an assembly position
file, all six copper layers, paste/mask/silkscreen/outline Gerbers, separate PTH
and NPTH drill files, and then runs `check_candidate.py`. Existing output is never
overwritten.

## 2026-09-02 baseline at `3e241dc`

- Board SHA-256: `cb4774b5ab76eb427bd70f0fb7dde17b7a1d7eb3c860826e94efeb7c9f91e93d`.
- All 14 expected Gerber/job files and both non-empty drill files exported; the
  drill report contains 139 PTH and 7 NPTH holes.
- Full BOM: 310 references. Schematic-fitted BOM: 294 references, with 16 DNP.
- CPL: 263 references.
- Real KiCad DRC: 205 board violations in the accepted baseline classes (199
  footprint-library, 5 hole-clearance, 1 solder-mask bridge), **plus 499
  unconnected-item errors** and 265 schematic-parity warnings.
- The 499 errors prove that the earlier RGB milestone completed only the four
  Demo replacement nets. The retained board is not routing-complete; its
  ratsnest was still 610 after RGB promotion.
- Schematic/PCB population parity is not release-safe: all 16 schematic DNP
  references leak into a PCB-derived CPL because their footprint DNP flags do
  not match: `C21 C22 C34 C35 C81 C82 L2 R44 R45 R68 R93 R107 R112 R119 R123 U13`.
- Procurement coverage is incomplete: 229 fitted references lack an MPN. Most
  are passives and test points, but `J8` is also in this set. This must be
  resolved through an explicit fitted/off-board/test-point population model,
  not by accepting an underspecified grouped BOM.

The generated files from this baseline are characterization artifacts only and
were deliberately not promoted into the repository. The authoritative Demo PCB
and schematic were not changed, and `hardware/beta-v2/` remained untouched.

## Retained-net routing ledger

`routing_ledger.py` is the deterministic connectivity authority for Demo routing
completion. It derives the 294 fitted references from the schematic BOM, removes
only the 16 explicit schematic-DNP references from routing obligations, and uses
KiCad's copper connectivity over distinct physical pad lands. The eight approved
Demo NC contacts are audited by exact identity (`J5.9`-`J5.12` and
`J5.15`-`J5.18`); no other connector contact is exempted.

Run it from the repository root:

```text
hardware/demo/manufacturing/routing_ledger.py /tmp/demo-routing-ledger.json
```

The accepted `988149f` baseline is pinned in `routing-ledger-baseline.json`:
173 retained multi-pad nets, 59 already connected, 114 open, and 581 retained
open edges. This reconciles exactly with KiCad's raw 610-edge ratsnest after
removing the 29 edges owed only by unpopulated DNP pads. `LS1` is correctly
off-board and `BOSS1/BOSS2` are PCB-only mechanical references.

## Next bounded task

The speaker-output cluster was promoted on 2026-09-02. `SPK_P`, `SPK_N`,
`SPK_P_CONN`, and `SPK_N_CONN` now connect `U5` through `R121`/`R122` to `J6`.
The class-D legs use 0.25 mm outer-layer copper with two 0.60/0.30 mm vias per
leg; connector legs remain on F.Cu. The retained ledger moved exactly 581 ->
577 edges and the raw ratsnest 610 -> 606. The authoritative refilled KiCad DRC
remains exactly 199 footprint-library, 5 inherited hole-clearance, and 1
inherited solder-mask-bridge report, with no new attributable class. Board hash:
`b85533a559f81ae8b49366b76ddbfcdaace3a0086c434d525d06eee0893729d4`.

IR routing characterization on 2026-09-02 corrected the earlier cluster
assumption. The fitted-pad ledger proves that `IR_GATE` is a separate long-haul
signal: its three pads (`R22.2`, `Q1.1`, and the safe-off pull-down `R23.1`)
span **110.586 mm** and account for two open edges. The LED-current loop is the
genuinely local cluster: `IR_LED_A` spans 9.282 mm with two open edges and
`IR_LED_K` spans 5.307 mm with one. `R123` is DNP and must not be counted as a
required routing endpoint or used to satisfy fitted connectivity.

A first combined scratch topology was rejected before promotion: forcing all
three nets through one outer/inner-layer pattern crossed accepted top-edge
copper and did not provide a legal local current loop. The authoritative board
did not absorb that attempt.

The separated local-current task was promoted on 2026-09-02. `IR_LED_A` now
connects fitted `R24.1`, `D1.2`, and `TP39.1`; `IR_LED_K` connects `D1.1` to
`Q1.3`. Both use 0.30 mm F.Cu with no vias, preserve the 12 ohm current limit,
leave DNP trim `R123` electrically optional, and keep the emitter/FET loop at
the top edge. The retained ledger moved exactly 577 -> 574 edges and raw
ratsnest 606 -> 603. Real KiCad DRC remains exactly 199 footprint-library, 5
inherited hole-clearance, and 1 inherited solder-mask-bridge report, with no
new attributable class. Board hash:
`ddebb3500f445524bd932aaff055f7c60f6d5bca17cee25f64ed0624d2bfbf67`.

The separated `IR_GATE` task was promoted on 2026-09-02. The FET gate and
reset-safe `R23` pull-down join on 0.20 mm F.Cu at the top edge; a two-via
0.60/0.30 mm In2.Cu haul reaches `R22.2` without bypassing the series gate
resistor. All three fitted pads are one copper island. The retained ledger
moved exactly 574 -> 572 edges and raw ratsnest 603 -> 601. A zone-refilled
full-board KiCad DRC remains exactly 267 total reports / 499 raw unconnected
items, with no `IR_GATE` report or new attributable class. Board hash:
`b74cd3c059c50bc4edeb7ba17b6b20a2067abe19ae31e159bc6d5c517f757b24`.

Next, characterize and route the local `ACC_5V_RAW` boost-output cluster as one
bounded switching-power transaction. It has six fitted pads and five retained
open edges across only 13.001 mm, so it is the highest-leverage compact
non-plane cluster. Preserve U21's output loop, U22 input decoupling, locked
width/clearance rules, and the already accepted `ACC_5V_SW_EN` copper. Do not
fold `ACC_5V_SW` connector distribution or plane-net work into that local
transaction. Manufacturing export resumes only after all retained connections
are closed; population-flag synchronization and MPN coverage remain subsequent
release blockers.
