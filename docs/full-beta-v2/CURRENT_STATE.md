## 1. Authoritative HEAD
- **FBV2-P2-003X / D-298 (this checkpoint):** a governed **CTO IMPLEMENT + SCREEN + HANDOFF** — the
  bounded U19 CAPACITY lever (`AQROOT_U19CAP`: reserve the U19.7/U19.6 shared east escape lane so
  `LTC4368_FAULT_N` detours, and close `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7` before `N_BATDIV U19.6`) is implemented
  env-gated / **OFF by default**, pinned by regression **G14**, and **screened DRC-clean** on the real
  003W full-run board (both boxed U19 pins escape SIMULTANEOUSLY onto bare In3/In2 with the only
  board-legal 0.65/0.40 via — a capacity ADD, categorically distinct from the refuted D-296 swap).
  **Copper is NOT promoted** — the ~22-min full-authority gate (net +2 vs swap; FAULT_N clean detour)
  has not run (exceeds the ACP cap; may not be backgrounded). Source is left **uncommitted** (docs
  committed) per the 003X discipline; **autonomy CONTINUES** (no owner decision raised). Next:
  **FBV2-P2-003Y** executes the gate (§5).
- **FBV2-P2-003W / D-297 milestone commit (prior checkpoint):** a governed **ACCEPT of a
  SECONDARY lever + a governed FAIL of the overall Phase-A run** (source + docs + probe commit);
  **autonomy CONTINUES** (a normal Phase-A FAIL is not a stop reason; no owner decision raised).
  003W implemented the D-295/D-296 SECONDARY lever — an env-gated (`AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN`, **OFF by
  default**) override that completes the `BAT_PROTECTED_P U18.8 → R75.2` reserve **JOIN on In3**
  instead of the severed In2 lane — as a +25/−1-line change to `checks/route_battery_block.py`, pinned
  by a **G13** regression contract in `checks/router_regression.py` and the measured-record probe
  `checks/u18_i3_join_probe_003w.py`. **The wall (D-294/295):** at the direction-2 placement
  `t_a_r77e15n10_r79e15n10` the two 0.35/0.20 **THROUGH** reserve vias land at `R75.2`(2.800,66.800)
  and `U18.8`(7.200,66.500) on In2, and their In2 JOIN is `NO_PATH` — a `BAT_RAW` 0.600 mm
  current-path wall runs vertically on In2 at x≈6.4→6.65 (y 50.45→70.40), severing the west→east
  lane. **The lever:** the reserve vias are THROUGH vias (copper on every layer), so the join is
  electrically identical on In2 or In3; **In3.Cu is a routable six-layer signal layer**
  (`ROUTABLE[6]=('F','B','I2','I3')`) that is **EMPTY across the whole corridor** on the real
  full-run board (2 In3 tracks board-wide, none here; no In3 pour — only the In1/In4 GND planes), so
  `AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3` completes the ONE branch on In3 with **NO new via, NO DRU/floor change, NO
  topology change**; unset → the join stays on `va[2]` (In2), byte-identical to every prior run. **The
  probe** (on the actual full-run routed board, throwaway copy): In2 join `NO_PATH`, In3 join **ok
  4.410 mm**, real KiCad DRC **ZERO new classes**, `via_dangling` **1→0**. **The full authority gate**
  (`checks/w/phaseA_003t_full_003w_u18bpp_i3.json`, secs 1272.5) vs the D-294 baseline
  `w/phaseA_003t_full_e15n10cto.json`: connections **69→70** (+1), skipped-already-connected **98→99**
  (+1 — one downstream `BAT_PROTECTED_P` pad now found already-joined on the closed net; a positive
  sign, not a loss), ratsnest **708/−73 → 707/−74**, journal **72→73** (+1: `JOIN U18.8→R75.2` layer
  **I3**, 4.410 mm, **0 vias**), DRC `via_dangling` **1→0** with **no new class**
  (`{hole_clearance:5, lib_footprint_issues:199, solder_mask_bridge:1, track_width:1,
  unconnected_items:499}`), terminal fatal wall **UNCHANGED** (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7→(node)
  NO_LEGAL_ESCAPE`, `N_BATDIV U19.6` next-in-line). **The decisive diff is a STRICT PURE GAIN:** the
  entire journal delta is **exactly one added JOIN entry with NOTHING lost** — the categorical
  opposite of D-296's 1-for-1 swap; the In3 join takes routing capacity from **no other net** (In3 is
  unused), so no casualty is possible and none occurs. **Ruling:** the SECONDARY lever is a genuine,
  board-legal, verified net gain — **ACCEPTED** and retained env-gated/OFF-by-default in tracked
  source (byte-identical when unset), pinned by G13 + the probe. **But copper is NOT promoted:**
  Phase-A copper promotes only on a full-authority PASS (D-286), and the run still FAILs on the
  unchanged saturated U19 field — so the authoritative board stays six layers / 0 tracks / 0 vias and
  **readiness/progress DO NOT move.** D-297 **banks** the U18.8 closure in source: once the U19 field
  is separately enlarged, this lever (ON) yields the U18.8 join for free (no new via, no new DRC).
  **No copper, no placement, no rule, no floor, no topology/footprint/outline change; no DRC absorbed;
  no promotion.** `/home/aqroot8/.aqroot-autopilot-stop` is ABSENT; autonomy continues with
  **FBV2-P2-003X** (§5) — a bounded U19 capacity lever for the simultaneous `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7` +
  `N_BATDIV U19.6` closure. Prior milestone: `27f9790` (D-296, 003V PRIMARY reservation family
  refuted). This checkpoint is written in the same commit; a fresh session must confirm the live tip
  with `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git rev-parse origin/master`.
- **Prior FBV2-P2-003V / D-296 milestone:** a governed **FAIL / primary-family refutation** commit
  (docs only); **autonomy CONTINUES**. 003V implemented the D-295 PRIMARY lever — an env-gated
  (`AQROOT_U19_RESV`, OFF by default) reservation of `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`'s B.Cu escape scored toward
  Q7.1 — and full-gate-ran it twice. **RESV (0.35/0.20)** is behaviourally identical to D-294 (the
  corridor-less sub-minimum via is rejected on `via_diameter`/`annular_width`, the reservation is
  dropped, the run falls through unchanged; connected-set diff EMPTY both ways). **RESV2 (0.60/0.30
  board-legal)** FIRES and CLOSES U19.7 (rung self-corrects to the ordinary Default 0.60/0.30) — but
  it is a bounded **ordering trade**: conn 69 / skip 98 / ratsnest 708/−73 all unchanged, DRC
  identical, the terminal wall merely MOVES to `N_BATDIV U19.6`. **The decisive diff (D-294→RESV2) is
  a strict 1-for-1 swap:** GAINED `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7→Q7.1`, LOST `REF_POL TP24.1→U19.2`, count 68→68 —
  the U19 field is capacity-saturated, so reserving U19.7's lane only chooses which neighbour is
  abandoned. Positive finding recorded (the mechanism is REAL, U19.7 closable in principle,
  board-legal) but a swap is not a net gain, so per D-286 nothing promotes copper. **The
  `AQROOT_U19_RESV` source WIP was RETIRED** via an exact reverse patch (`git apply -R`; worktree blob
  `bba62d35…` = `HEAD:checks/route_battery_block.py`, `git grep U19_RESV` no match). No source/copper/
  placement/rule change survived; no DRC absorbed; no promotion. Prior milestone: `a2e27fc` (D-295).
- **Prior FBV2-P2-003U / D-295 milestone:** a governed **characterization / NO-PROGRESS + HANDOFF**
  commit (docs only); autonomy CONTINUES. 003U proved both D-294 walls are FULL-RUN-EMERGENT
  ordering/congestion casualties and NO cheap vehicle judges either at the direction-2 placement. The
  PRIMARY (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`) was diagnosed EXACTLY and shown REDUCIBLE-in-principle (it escaped
  cleanly in 003O as `U19.7→Q7.1` F.Cu 14.907 mm; direction-2's +2-connection congestion **swapped
  `VREC_VCC`'s two segments' layers** — `U19.8→C60.1` went B.Cu(0 via)→F.Cu(2 via) — so U19.8's
  pad-escape now occupies the F lane immediately south of U19.7 that carried U19.7 in 003O; `U19.8`
  ×26 the dominant blocker; U19.7 is a greedy-tightest-first casualty and, as a `(node)` join,
  ineligible for the D-278 inner hop guarded `and not node`). The SECONDARY (U18.8 I2 join corridor)
  is a full-congestion I2 pinch. The ~22-min governing gate cannot run foreground under the ACP
  10-min cap, so 003U delivered a precise CTO handoff. No source/copper/placement/rule change; no DRC
  absorbed; no promotion. Prior milestone: `36662db` (D-294).
- **HEAD == origin/master:** yes (committed and pushed at milestone closeout).
- **Prior milestones (full detail in §4 and CTO_DECISIONS):** `27f9790` D-296 (003V) PRIMARY
  reservation family refuted / WIP retired; `a2e27fc` D-295 (003U) two-walls characterization +
  handoff; `36662db` D-294 (003T) direction-2 executed / full gate FAIL; `9c708f3` D-293 owner
  approval of direction 2.

## 2. Mission
- Deliver Full Beta v2 to **READY FOR JLCPCB** — a fabricable, assembly-ready
  authoritative board with all governing routing / DRC / ERC / connectivity / safety
  gates passing and the final JLCPCB deliverables generated and reviewed.
- Terminal condition: **READY FOR JLCPCB**.

## 3. Current phase / gate
- **Phase P2 — battery/power-block Phase-A routing**, specifically completing a full Phase-A run at
  the D-293 direction-2 placement `t_a_r77e15n10_r79e15n10` with `BAT_PROTECTED_P` closed.
- **Current fabrication blocker (updated by D-297).** Direction-2 (D-294) plus the two accepted
  bounded levers have resolved the west/BAT_RAW and U18.8 walls; **the SINGLE remaining Phase-A
  fabrication blocker is the SIMULTANEOUS closure of the saturated U19 dead-cell field** — terminal
  `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7→(node) NO_LEGAL_ESCAPE` (blocked by U19.8 ×26 / U19.6 ×13 / U19.5 ×7 / track ×6),
  with `N_BATDIV U19.6` the next-in-line wall (D-296). Status of the two prior walls:
  - **U18.8 (`BAT_PROTECTED_P`) — CLOSED IN PRINCIPLE, banked (D-297).** The In3 reserve-JOIN lever
    is an ACCEPTED, board-legal +1 net gain (`U18.8→R75.2` on In3, 4.410 mm, 0 vias, `via_dangling`
    cleared, no new DRC). It is retained OFF-by-default in source and turns ON in the 003X full run;
    it is NOT yet promoted because the full run still fails on U19.
  - **REF_POL R87.2 F-corridor wall — PAST under direction-2** (+2 connections vs 003O); re-verify
    downstream on a full PASS.
  - **U19 dead-cell field — the terminal blocker; lever built + screened (D-298).** D-296 proved a
    single-pin reservation only SWAPS the casualty; D-298 built the capacity ADD: `AQROOT_U19CAP`
    reserves the U19.7/U19.6 shared east lane so `LTC4368_FAULT_N` detours and closes U19.7 before
    U19.6, so both escape simultaneously onto bare In3/In2 (screened DRC-clean). Awaiting the
    FBV2-P2-003Y full gate to judge net gain vs swap. Bounded CTO-scope, NOT an owner decision.
  - **BAT_RAW R89.1/R86.2 divider taps** — a capacity symptom, not a width lever; re-verify on a full
    PASS.

## 4. Last accepted milestone
- **Task:** FBV2-P2-003W · **Decision:** **D-297** · **Result:** THE SECONDARY U18.8 I2-JOIN LEVER
  (the D-295/D-296 HANDOFF) COMPLETES `BAT_PROTECTED_P U18.8→R75.2` ON In3 FOR A **GENUINE +1
  CONNECTED-SET GAIN** — A PURE JOIN WITH NO CASUALTY, NO NEW VIA, NO NEW DRC CLASS, AND THE LONE
  `via_dangling` CLEARED — SO IT IS **ACCEPTED** AND RETAINED ENV-GATED / OFF-BY-DEFAULT IN TRACKED
  SOURCE; BUT COPPER IS NOT PROMOTED (THE FULL RUN STILL FAILs ON THE SATURATED U19 FIELD), SO
  READINESS/PROGRESS DO NOT MOVE. The reserve vias are THROUGH vias, so the join is electrically
  identical on In2/In3; In3.Cu is a routable six-layer signal layer (`ROUTABLE[6]=('F','B','I2','I3')`)
  EMPTY across the whole corridor (only In1/In4 GND pours), so `AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3` completes the
  ONE branch on In3 within D-257/D-266 mechanics. Probe (on the actual full-run routed board): In2
  `NO_PATH`, In3 **ok 4.410 mm**, real KiCad DRC ZERO new classes, `via_dangling` 1→0. Full gate
  (`w/phaseA_003t_full_003w_u18bpp_i3.json`, secs 1272.5) vs the D-294 baseline
  `w/phaseA_003t_full_e15n10cto.json`: connections **69→70**, skipped-already-connected **98→99**,
  ratsnest **708/−73→707/−74**, journal **72→73** (+1 `JOIN U18.8→R75.2` I3 4.410 mm 0 vias),
  `via_dangling` **1→0** with no new DRC class, terminal fatal wall UNCHANGED (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`,
  `N_BATDIV U19.6` next). The entire journal delta is EXACTLY one added JOIN with NOTHING lost — the
  opposite of D-296's swap; the In3 join takes capacity from no other net (In3 unused). A governed CTO
  ACCEPT + overall-run FAIL, NOT an owner decision (no floor relaxed, no frozen part moved, direction-2
  not exhausted); autonomy CONTINUES; no copper/placement/rule/floor/topology change, no DRC absorbed,
  no promotion, D-275 and D-277..D-296 preserved. Tests: `router_regression.py` ALL PASS incl. new
  **G13** (In3 routable; lever OFF by default → byte-identical; `=I3` activates; non-I2/I3 never
  activates; override scoped to exactly `BAT_PROTECTED_P U18.8→R75.2`); `u18_i3_join_probe_003w.py`
  ALL PASS. Evidence of record: audit

- **Prior milestone — FBV2-P2-003V · Decision:** **D-296** · **Result:** THE PRIMARY U19.7
  ESCAPE-RESERVATION LEVER (the D-295 handoff) FIRES AND CLOSES U19.7 WITH A BOARD-LEGAL 0.60/0.30
  VIA, BUT IT IS A BOUNDED ORDERING TRADE WITH NO CONNECTED-SET PROGRESS — IT MERELY CHOOSES WHICH PIN
  OF THE SATURATED U19 FIELD IS THE CASUALTY (RESV2 GAINED `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7→Q7.1`, LOST `REF_POL
  TP24.1→U19.2`; conn 69/skip 98/ratsnest 708/−73 all unchanged; DRC identical; wall moves U19.7→U19.6;
  requested-connected 68→68). RESV (0.35/0.20) is behaviourally identical to D-294 (illegal
  sub-minimum via dropped; diff EMPTY both ways). REJECTED for production; the `AQROOT_U19_RESV` source
  WIP RETIRED via exact reverse patch (worktree blob `bba62d35…` = `HEAD:checks/route_battery_block.py`;
  `git grep U19_RESV` no match). Positive finding preserved (mechanism real, U19.7 closable in
  principle, board-legal). A governed FAIL, NOT an owner decision; autonomy CONTINUES; no
  source/copper/placement/rule change, no DRC absorbed, no promotion, D-275 and D-277..D-295 preserved.

- **Prior milestone — FBV2-P2-003U · Decision:** **D-295** · **Result:** THE TWO D-294 WALLS ARE
  FULL-RUN-EMERGENT ORDERING/CONGESTION CASUALTIES — NO CHEAP VEHICLE JUDGES EITHER AT THE DIRECTION-2
  PLACEMENT — AND THE PRIMARY (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`) IS DIAGNOSED EXACTLY AND SHOWN
  REDUCIBLE-IN-PRINCIPLE; THE GOVERNING ~22-min FULL GATE CANNOT RUN FOREGROUND UNDER THE ACP 10-min
  CAP, SO 003U DELIVERS A PRECISE CTO HANDOFF. A governed CTO characterization / NO-PROGRESS + HANDOFF,
  NOT an owner decision; autonomy CONTINUES; no source/copper/placement/rule change, no DRC absorbed,

- **Prior milestone — FBV2-P2-003T · Decision:** **D-294** · **Result:** DIRECTION 2 (D-293)
  EXECUTED — A FOCUSED MINIMUM CANDIDATE (`t_a_r77e15n10_r79e15n10`) GENUINELY EXISTS, BUT THE
  GOVERNING FULL AUTHORITY GATE FAILs, SO NO CANDIDATE IS PROMOTABLE. Direction-2 is PRODUCTIVE (+2
  connections vs 003O, `REF_POL R87.2` wall now past) but INCOMPLETE (U18.8 I2 join `NO_PATH`; new
  terminal `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7 NO_LEGAL_ESCAPE`). A governed CTO FAIL, NOT an owner decision; autonomy
  CONTINUES; no promotion, D-275 and D-277..D-293 preserved. Evidence: audit

- **Prior milestone — FBV2-P2-003S · Decision:** **D-292** · **Result:** THE OWNER-APPROVED BOUNDED
  LTC4368/R75 PLACEMENT MICRO-ECO (D-291) IS SCREENED TO EXHAUSTION — NO BOUNDED U18/R75 PLACEMENT
  LEGALLY CO-CLOSES THE U18 ESCAPE FIELD (a both-edges current-path footprint geometry). A governed
  CTO FAIL that re-raised the OWNER decision (resolved by D-293). Evidence: audit
  [`audits/2026-08-29-p2-003s-d292-u18-r75-placement-microeco-exhausted.md`](audits/2026-08-29-p2-003s-d292-u18-r75-placement-microeco-exhausted.md).
- **Prior milestones — D-290/D-289/D-288/D-287/D-286** (full detail in CTO_DECISIONS and the audits):
  D-290 the last routing-only U18 co-closure lever refuted (owner decision, resolved by D-293);
  D-289 the 003P WIP retired and U18 co-closure refuted; D-288 the D-275 south-bridge entry-array
  two-layer tie fixed (`via_dangling`-clean, electrical pass); D-287 direction-1 space exhausted
  (27/27); D-286 the gate baseline measured on the actual complete pre-copper placement (regression
  G12).

## 5. Next task — FBV2-P2-003Y (execute the D-298 full-authority gate for the U19 CAPACITY lever)
- **Where 003X left it (D-298).** The bounded U19 CAPACITY lever is **implemented, regression-pinned
  (G14), and screened DRC-clean** on the real 003W full-run board — but **copper is NOT promoted**
  (the ~22-min full gate has not run; it exceeds the ACP 10-min cap and may not be backgrounded).
  The lever is banked env-gated / **OFF by default** in tracked source (uncommitted WIP).
- **Root cause (measured).** U19.6/U19.7 are a **BOTTOM SOT-23-8**, pad-boxed N/S by neighbour pads
  (placement-fixed); their only non-pad directions **E/W** are walled by control tracks. **The EAST
  lane is walled for BOTH by the same `LTC4368_FAULT_N R82.1→Q9.1` 64 mm B.Cu run.** POFV (via-in-pad)
  is **DRU-BARRED** — the fine 0.35/0.20 via (annular 0.075) is DRU-legal only for named escapes, and
  `U19.6/U19.7` are the only U19 pins WITHOUT a D-257 exception (`U19.2/U19.3/U19.5` have one); the
  only globally-legal via is 0.65/0.40, which fits only if the tighter pin escapes first.
- **The lever — `AQROOT_U19CAP` (a capacity ADD, not the D-296 swap).** (a) reserve the U19.7/U19.6
  shared east escape lane with a keep-out so `LTC4368_FAULT_N` (a low-current run with ample slack)
  **detours**; lift it before the closure stage; (b) close `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7` **before** `N_BATDIV
  U19.6` (U19.6-first re-boxes U19.7). Both then escape SIMULTANEOUSLY onto bare **In3 / In2** with the
  legal 0.65/0.40 via — screened DRC-clean (zero new violation involving those nets). OFF → byte-
  identical. **No DRU change, no via below the D-257 ladder, no D-290 re-auth, no topology/footprint/
  outline change.**
- **The governing run (CTO, persistent terminal, ~22 min):**
  `cd hardware/beta-v2/checks && cp phaseA_journal.json /tmp/phaseA_journal.HEAD.json &&
  AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3 AQROOT_U19CAP=1 bash w/run_003t_full.sh 003x_u19cap
  w/cand_003t/t_a_r77e15n10_r79e15n10.json && cp /tmp/phaseA_journal.HEAD.json phaseA_journal.json`.
  Keep `AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3` ON (D-297); do NOT combine with `AQROOT_U19_RESV` (refuted, D-296).
  **Judge by the full-run connected-set diff** vs `phaseA_003o_b1_r75rot_cto.json` and
  `w/phaseA_003t_full_003w_u18bpp_i3.json`: the run must close **U19.7 AND U19.6 together for a real
  net gain** with no new DRC class (a swap is NOT a gain — D-296). **Promote copper only on a genuine
  full-authority Phase-A PASS** (D-286). All floors ENFORCED; D-290 stays closed.
- **The two full-gate risks (D-298 §5/§8).** (1) Does `LTC4368_FAULT_N` **detour cleanly** under full
  congestion (the driver's per-connection `gate()` enforces it; the probe's crude whole-net reroute
  grazed BAT_MAIN as an artifact)? (2) Is it a net +2 or a swap? If FAULT_N cannot detour clean, the
  sharp next lever is a **DRU fine-via escape exception for `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`/`N_BATDIV U19.6`**,
  mirroring the existing D-257 exceptions for U19.2/U19.3/U19.5 — that is a **DRU change / owner
  re-authorization**, not a routing lever.
- **Downstream, still CTO-scope:** on a full PASS, re-verify the (now-past) `REF_POL R87.2`
  F-corridor and the BAT_RAW R89.1/R86.2 divider taps.

## 6. Authoritative PCB state
- **Routing/promotion:** NOT promoted. Authoritative board = **six copper layers,
  0 signal tracks, 0 signal vias** (verified `sha256 2235e273…d642d7e`, byte-identical to HEAD);
  placement untouched (C36 home 63.75,73.75,0°; U18 home 3.0,72.4,90°). All 003O/003T/003W bridge/
  full-run copper lived only in gitignored scratch (`checks/w/`) and override files; the natural-run
  003O result `checks/phaseA_003o_b1_r75rot_cto.json` is committed as evidence of record, and the
  003T/003W full-authority results stay gitignored under scratch
  (`checks/w/phaseA_003t_full_e15n10cto.json`, `…003w_u18bpp_i3.json`, `FULL003T_e15n10cto/`).
- **Banked in source (D-297), NOT in copper:** the OFF-by-default `AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN` In3-join lever
  (byte-identical when unset) closes `U18.8→R75.2` for a proven +1 gain when ON; it awaits the U19
  field closure and a full Phase-A PASS before any copper is promoted.
- **Uncommitted WIP in source (D-298), NOT in copper:** the OFF-by-default `AQROOT_U19CAP` U19
  east-lane reservation + U19.7-first lever (byte-identical when unset), pinned by regression G14 and
  screened DRC-clean by `checks/w/u19cap_probe_003x.py`; it awaits the ~22-min full-authority gate
  (FBV2-P2-003Y) to judge net gain vs swap before any copper is promoted. Source
  (`route_battery_block.py`, `router_regression.py`) is left uncommitted per the 003X discipline.
- `phaseA_journal.json` at its committed HEAD state (driver never authoritatively invoked; the shared
  journal was backed up and restored around the full run; scratch churn discarded).
- PCB routing **0 %**; overall repo progress **74 %**.

## 7. Locked invariants (reference the D-xxx rulings, not the history)
- **D-275** forced-south `BAT_PROTECTED_P` bridge geometry (lane + landing proven). **D-288** the
  entry-array two-layer tie is FIXED (rotation-aware in-pad `scan_entry_sites` + symmetric B.Cu
  tie-stub, `via_dangling`-clean; an electrical pass, not merely geometric). The **0.60 mm BAT_MAIN
  minimum width** rule is a hard floor.
- **D-277..D-280** U19/deadcell escape + C61 landing-guard gains.
- **D-281/282/283** western-corridor route-scope fixes exhausted; **D-284 (OWNER)** approved
  landing-opening direction 1; **D-285** `place_003l` opens the C36.1 landing (clean).
- **D-286** the gate baseline is measured on the actual complete pre-copper placement; candidate
  placements must be screened with real full-placement DRC; a genuine placement short must be
  surfaced, never absorbed. **No proxy (focused vehicle / partial run) promotes copper — only a
  genuine full-authority Phase-A PASS does.** Regression G12 pins the corrected baseline order.
- **D-287** the bounded direction-1 placement space is EXHAUSTED (27/27); a `via_dangling` item is a
  genuine electrical fault and MUST fail.
- **D-289/D-290** the residual U18.8 `BAT_PROTECTED_P` escape is a **placement-geometry
  mutual-exclusion** at the 0.5 mm pad pitch vs the 0.300 mm current-path floor (D-269); the
  routing-only co-closure space (off-layer vacate of U18.7) is REFUTED — no routing-only site
  remains, so the U18.8 escape was an OWNER decision, **RESOLVED by D-293 (direction 2 authorized).**
- **D-293 (OWNER)** authorized **direction 2** — bounded LTC4368-block spread / escape-target
  relocation (R77/R79 east, R80/R81 north) so `BAT_RAW` (U18.1 east) and `BAT_PROTECTED_P` (U18.8
  west) escape through independent corridors — without relaxing D-269 or any floor, without accepting
  U18.8 open, without re-litigating D-290.
- **D-294 (003T)** direction 2 was EXECUTED under full CTO authority: a focused minimum candidate
  exists but the full gate FAILs, so no candidate is promotable. Direction-2 is PRODUCTIVE (+2 vs
  003O, `REF_POL R87.2` now past) but INCOMPLETE. **A focused `fail=None` is VACUOUS vs the congested
  full run — judge Phase-A changes by the full-run connected-set diff, promote copper only on
  full-authority evidence.**
- **D-295 (003U)** the two D-294 walls are full-run-emergent ordering/congestion casualties and no
  cheap vehicle judges either at the direction-2 placement; the PRIMARY (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7`) is
  reducible-in-principle (direction-2's +2-connection congestion swapped `VREC_VCC U19.8`'s pad-escape
  from B.Cu onto the F lane U19.7 needs); both bounded levers are judgeable only by the ~22-min full
  gate. The U19.7 wall is an ordering class, NOT a D-289/290/292 placement mutual-exclusion.
- **D-296 (003V)** the PRIMARY U19.7 escape-reservation family is **REFUTED**: with a board-legal
  0.60/0.30 via the reservation fires and closes U19.7, but the U19 dead-cell field is
  **capacity-saturated on F.Cu/B.Cu**, so a single-pin reservation is a bounded **ordering trade** —
  it swaps the casualty (U19.7 ⇄ U19.2, wall U19.7→U19.6), earning NO net connected-set progress. Do
  NOT re-try single-pin U19 reservation; the U19 field needs a lever that ENLARGES capacity, not one
  that re-orders it.
- **D-297 (003W)** the SECONDARY U18.8 I2-join is closed by a **capacity add, not an ordering trade**:
  the reserve vias are THROUGH vias, In3.Cu is a routable six-layer signal layer that is bare across
  this corridor, so completing `U18.8→R75.2` on In3 (`AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3`) is a **genuine +1
  connected-set gain with no casualty, no new via, no new DRC class, and clears `via_dangling`** —
  because it takes capacity from no other net. **ACCEPTED and banked env-gated/OFF-by-default in
  source; copper is NOT promoted while the full run still FAILs on the U19 field.** The general lesson:
  the bare inner signal layers In2/In3 are unused capacity in this corridor and are the correct
  vehicle for enlarging a saturated F.Cu/B.Cu field (the U19 direction for 003X).
- **D-298 (003X)** the U19 field is closable by a **capacity ADD, not a swap**: U19.6/U19.7 (BOTTOM
  SOT-23-8) are pad-boxed N/S; their shared EAST lane is walled by the same `LTC4368_FAULT_N`
  cross-board run; POFV is DRU-barred (U19.6/U19.7 lack the D-257 fine-via exception the other three
  U19 pins have), so the escape needs a clear lateral lane + the legal 0.65/0.40 via. The
  `AQROOT_U19CAP` lever **reserves the shared east lane** (FAULT_N detours) and **closes U19.7 before
  U19.6** — both then escape SIMULTANEOUSLY onto bare In3/In2, screened DRC-clean. IMPLEMENTED,
  regression-pinned (G14), OFF-by-default, uncommitted; **copper NOT promoted** — the net-gain-vs-swap
  verdict and FAULT_N's clean detour are the ~22-min full gate's job (D-286). Categorically distinct
  from the refuted D-296 single-pin lateral swap.
- Rule floors ENFORCED: **0.200 mm** clearance, **0.25 mm** hole-to-hole, **0.300 mm** current-path
  routed clearance (D-269), **≥1.20 mm** BPP trunk width (D-249), **0.60 mm** BAT_MAIN minimum width.
  Six-layer stack, GND, netclasses, footprints, polarity, safety set — all frozen. Frozen
  `beta-full-reference-v1` untouched.

## 8. Open owner decisions
- **NONE. D-293 resolved the last owner decision (direction 2 authorized); D-294 (003T), D-295
  (003U), D-296 (003V) and D-297 (003W) each re-raised none.** Direction 2 is being executed under
  full CTO authority; the U18.8 wall is now closed in principle by the accepted D-297 In3-join lever
  (banked OFF-by-default in source), and the sole remaining Phase-A blocker — the saturated U19
  dead-cell field (`REC_BAT_LOW U19.7` + `N_BATDIV U19.6`) — is **bounded CTO-scope routing/capacity
  work, not an owner decision** (no floor relaxed, no frozen part moved, direction-2 not exhausted).
  Autonomy CONTINUES with **FBV2-P2-003X** (§5). Historical options (B accept-U18.8-open, D
  re-litigate-D-290) are retained only as context and are not active.
- **Nothing has been changed under any decision:** no part moved, no floor relaxed, no DRC absorbed
  into the authoritative board; the authoritative PCB is six layers / 0 tracks / 0 vias.

## 9. JLCPCB readiness
- **JLCPCB readiness ~77 %** (unchanged — 003W earned NO copper: it accepted a genuine +1 SECONDARY
  gain (U18.8 In3 join) and banked it OFF-by-default in source, but the full Phase-A run still FAILs
  on the U19 field, so no copper promoted; the authoritative board is still six layers / 0 tracks /
  0 vias). `/home/aqroot8/.aqroot-progress.env` unchanged (CTO owns readiness).
- **Repo progress 74 %** (governed value in PROGRESS.md).
- **What remains before fabrication:** close the U19 dead-cell field (simultaneous U19.7 + U19.6) and
  complete a full Phase-A PASS at the direction-2 placement (with the accepted D-297 U18.8 lever ON);
  promote the authoritative copper; then Phase-B production routing; full DRC/ERC/connectivity and
  regression closure on the authoritative board; RF/power/thermal/safety validation; BOM/footprint/
  polarity/DNP + assembly review; board-outline/stackup/fab-rule review; Gerber/drill/BOM/CPL
  generation and independent manufacturing-package review.

## 10. Active orchestration
- **Persistent CTO session:** `agent:main:aqroot-fbv2-cto` — sole owner of Claude engineering
  launches; receives every completion event.
- **Autopilot:** cron/systemd may only WAKE the persistent CTO; it must never launch Claude or become
  a task parent. No owner decision is open; the stop file is ABSENT and the persistent CTO continues
  one-Claude-at-a-time engineering.
- **Should an engineering process be active now?** **Yes.** FBV2-P2-003X implements ONE bounded,
  env-gated (OFF-by-default) U19 CAPACITY lever (offload a saturating U19-neighbour escape onto a bare
  inner layer In2/In3) to close `REC_BAT_LOW U19.7` AND `N_BATDIV U19.6` simultaneously, validate it
  against `router_regression.py` (authoritative byte-identical), then run the FULL authority gate
  (`AQROOT_U18BPP_JOIN=I3 <u19-lever> bash w/run_003t_full.sh 003x_u19cap
  w/cand_003t/t_a_r77e15n10_r79e15n10.json`, ~22 min, in a persistent terminal) and judge by the
  full-run connected-set diff (a 1-for-1 pin swap is NOT a gain — D-296). Promote copper only on a
  genuine full Phase-A PASS.
